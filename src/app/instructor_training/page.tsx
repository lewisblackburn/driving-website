          A Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) examiner will watch you
          giving a client-centred driving lesson to one of your pupils for about
          45 minutes. At the start of the lesson, discuss the goals for the
          lesson and risk management with your pupil. This should take no more
          than 3 minutes. Your pupil must drive for about 40 minutes of the
          lesson. You cannot spend the whole lesson teaching a manoeuvre, but
          you can include a short recap of one youâ€™ve taught in a previous
          lesson. If you need to give your pupil immediate feedback, you are
          allowed to stop safely during the lesson. At the end of the lesson,
          give your pupil no more than 3 minutes to reflect on their
          performance. The examiner will look for evidence that you meet the
          national standard for driver and rider training. Youâ€™ll be marked on
          17 areas of competence that are grouped into 3 categories: lesson
          planning risk management teaching and learning strategies. The 17
          areas of competence are listed in the ADI part 3 test report form,
          which the examiner will fill in at the end of your test. Youâ€™ll get a
          score from 0 to 3 for each of the 17 competencies, which are added up
          to work out if youâ€™ve passed the test, and what your grade will be.
